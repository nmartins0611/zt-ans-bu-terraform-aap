In this guide, you will create an execution environment that enables Terraform usage within the Ansible Automation Platform.

== Overview

All automation in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform runs inside container images called *automation execution environments*. These environments provide a standardized way to build, distribute, and manage the dependencies required for your automation.

To use Terraform within your Ansible Automation Platform, you must first build a custom execution environment that includes the Terraform binary, the `cloud.terraform` collection, and any other necessary dependencies. This guide walks you through that process using the `ansible-builder` tool.

ðŸ‘‹ *Welcome!*

Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes

.In this challenge, you will learn how to:
* Create the configuration files required by `ansible-builder`.
* Build a new execution environment container image.
* Add the new execution environment to Ansible Automation Platform.

'''

== Getting Started

To run Terraform commands from within Ansible Automation Platform, you will need an execution environment that contains both the Terraform binary and the certified `cloud.terraform` collection. This is easily accomplished using `ansible-builder`.

NOTE: You can perform the following steps in the provided `TERMINAL` or within the `VSCODE` tab. This guide uses the `TERMINAL`, but the commands are identical for both environments.

'''

== Task 1: Create Configuration Files

To build an execution environment, `ansible-builder` requires a definition file, which is typically named `execution-environment.yml`.

. **Navigate to the working directory.**
+
From the `TERMINAL` tab, you will start in the `/home/rhel` directory. Change to the `terraform-ee` project folder.
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cd /home/rhel/terraform-ee
----

. **Inspect the existing files.**
+
This directory already contains two empty files: `execution-environment.yml` and `requirements.yml`. You will add content to both.

. **Define the execution environment.**
+
**Open `execution-environment.yml`** using a text editor like `vim` or `nano` and **paste the following content** into the file.
+
[source,bash]
----
vim execution-environment.yml
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
version: 3

images:
  base_image:
    name: registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-25/ee-minimal-rhel8:latest

dependencies:
  galaxy: requirements.yml

options:
  package_manager_path: /usr/bin/microdnf

additional_build_steps:
  prepend_base:
    - RUN $PYCMD -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
  append_base:
    - RUN curl "https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.12.2/terraform_1.12.2_linux_amd64.zip" -o "/terraform.zip"
    - RUN unzip /terraform.zip -d /terraform
    - RUN mv /terraform/terraform /bin
----
+
This file provides the build instructions for `ansible-builder`:
+
`version`:: The schema version for the definition file.
`images.base_image`:: The container base image to build upon. We are using the minimal RHEL 8 execution environment image.
`dependencies.galaxy`:: A pointer to a file listing the Ansible Galaxy collections to install.
`additional_build_steps`:: Custom commands to run during the image build. Here, we download and install the Terraform binary so it's available for playbook execution.

. **Define the collection dependencies.**
+
Next, **open `requirements.yml`** and **paste the following content** into the file.
+
[source,bash]
----
vim requirements.yml
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
collections:
  - name: amazon.aws
  - name: cloud.terraform
  - name: google.cloud
----
+
This file lists the Ansible collections to be installed from Galaxy. Including `amazon.aws`, `cloud.terraform`, and `google.cloud` enables automation against AWS and GCP infrastructure using Terraform.

'''

== Task 2: Build the Execution Environment

With the configuration files in place, you can now build the container image.

. **Run the ansible-builder command.**
+
From the terminal, **execute the build command**. The `-v 3` flag sets the verbosity level, and `--tag` names the resulting image.
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-builder build -v 3 --tag terraform-ee
----
+
The build process will take a few minutes. Upon completion, you will see output confirming the image was created successfully.
+

. **Verify the new image.**
+
**List the local container images** using `podman` to see your newly built `terraform-ee` image.
+
[source,bash]
----
podman images
----

TIP: At this point, you would typically push the image to a container registry like Quay.io, Docker Hub, or a private Automation Hub. While we will use a pre-existing public image in the next step, the commands to tag and push your own image would look like this:

**Example commands on how to tag and then push the Execution Environment container image to Quay.io**
[source,bash]
----
# Tag the image for your registry
podman tag localhost/terraform-ee quay.io/[your-username]/terraform-ee

# Log in to the registry
podman login --username [your-username] quay.io

# Push the image
podman push quay.io/[your-username]/terraform-ee
----

'''

== Task 3: Add the Execution Environment to Ansible Automation Platform

Finally, add the new execution environment to make it available for use in your automation.

. **Log in to the Ansible Automation Platform.**
+
Navigate to the `Ansible Automation Platform` tab and log in with the following credentials:
+
*User:* `admin` +
*Password:* `ansible123!`

. **Navigate to Execution Environments.**
+
In the left-hand menu, **navigate to** `Execution â†’ Execution Environments`.

. **Create a new execution environment.**
+
**Click the `+ Create execution environment` button** and fill in the form with the following details.
+
.Execution Environment Details
|===
| Field | Value

| Name
| `myTerraform EE`

| Image
| `quay.io/acme_corp/terraform_ee`

| Pull
| `Only pull the image if not present before running`

| Registry credential
| `Quay Registry Credential`
|===
+
NOTE: The image `quay.io/acme_corp/terraform_ee` is public, so no registry credential is required. For this lab, we use this pre-existing image to demonstrate how you would add your own.

. **Save the new environment.**
+
**Click the `Create execution environment` button** to save your changes.
+

== Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully created and registered a new Terraform-enabled execution environment.

This custom environment is now available for use in job templates within Ansible Automation Platform, allowing you to run powerful infrastructure automation that combines Ansible and Terraform.
