[abstract]
In this optional challenge, you'll explore different ways to integrate Terraform and Ansible from the command line. You will use the Red Hat Certified Collection for Terraform and the Terraform providers for Ansible and Ansible Automation Platform (AAP).

---

== Overview

This lab demonstrates powerful command-line workflows for combining Terraform's infrastructure provisioning with Ansible's configuration management capabilities.

ðŸ‘‹ *Welcome!*

*Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes*

.In this challenge, you will learn how to:
* Install and use the `cloud.terraform` certified collection.
* Run an Ansible playbook that triggers a Terraform project.
* Use the Terraform providers for Ansible and Ansible Automation Platform.

NOTE: You can perform the following steps in the `TERMINAL` or within the `VSCODE` tab. This guide uses the `TERMINAL`, but the commands are identical for both.

== Certified Collections and Providers

Red Hat provides the `cloud.terraform` collection as a certified, tested method for orchestrating Terraform from within Ansible.

.Additionally, for more Terraform-centric workflows, there are two community providers available on the Terraform Registry:
* **`ansible/ansible`**: The Terraform Provider for Ansible, for managing a local Ansible inventory.
* **`ansible/aap`**: The Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform, for interacting with Ansible Automation Platform resources.

This challenge will give you command-line exposure to these powerful integration tools.

---

== Task 1: Install and Use the `cloud.terraform` Red Hat Certified Collection

First, you'll use the `ansible-playbook` command to run a playbook that leverages the `cloud.terraform` collection to manage infrastructure.

. **Install the collection.**
+
**Open** the `TERMINAL` and **install** the collection from Ansible Galaxy.
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy collection install cloud.terraform
----
+
. **Verify the collection is installed.**
+
**Run** the following command to verify the collection is installed.
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-galaxy collection list
----
+
. **Navigate to the project directory.**
+
**Change** into the correct lab directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd /home/rhel/lab_exercises/2.Terraform_Ansible
----
+
. **Create an Ansible playbook.**
+
**Create** a new file named `deploy.yml` and **paste** the following content into it.
+
[source,yaml]
----
---
    - name: Infrastructure Deployment
      hosts: localhost

      vars:
        project_dir: /home/rhel/lab_exercises/2.Terraform_Ansible
      
      tasks:
      
        - name: Basic deploy of an instance
          cloud.terraform.terraform:
            project_path: '{{ project_dir }}'
            state: present
            force_init: true
      
        - name: Remove Instance
          cloud.terraform.terraform:
            project_path: '{{ project_dir }}'
            state: absent
            force_init: true
          tags:
            - never
            - remove
----

 This playbook has two main tasks: the first uses `state: present` to create infrastructure, and the second uses `state: absent` to destroy it. The second task will only run when the `remove` tag is specified.

. **Run the playbook to create infrastructure.**
+
**Execute** the playbook. This will trigger the Terraform project located in the current directory (`project_path`).
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook deploy.yml
----

. **Verify creation in AWS.**
+
**Click** the `AWS Console` tab, **log in** with the provided credentials, and **verify** that the new infrastructure (VPC, Subnets, EC2 instance, etc.) has been created.
+

. **Run the playbook to destroy infrastructure.**
+
Now, **run** the playbook again, but this time **use the `remove` tag** to execute the second task and clean up the resources.
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook deploy.yml --tags remove
----
+
While still in the AWS console, observe that the resources have been removed.

---
== Task 2: Use the Terraform Provider for Ansible

This optional task demonstrates how to use the `ansible/ansible` provider to manage a local Ansible inventory directly from your Terraform configuration.

. **Navigate to the project directory.**
+
**Change** into the correct lab directory.
+
[source,bash]
----
cd /home/rhel/lab_exercises/3.Terraform_Provider
----

. **Update the Terraform providers.**
+
**Edit** the `main.tf` file to add the `ansible/ansible` provider to the `required_providers` block.
+
.Before
[source,terraform]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 6.0"
    }
  }
}
----
+
.After
[source,terraform]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    ansible = {
      version = "~> 1.3.0"
      source  = "ansible/ansible"
    }
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 6.0"
    }
  }
}
----

. **Add your SSH public key.**
+
First, **get** your public key from the terminal.
+
[source,bash]
----
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
----
+
Next, **copy** the output and **paste** it into the `public_key` argument of the `aws_key_pair` resource in `main.tf`.

. **Add the Ansible host resource.**
+
**Add** the following `ansible_host` resource block to the end of `main.tf`. This tells the provider to add the new EC2 instance to the `nginx` group in the Ansible inventory.
+
[source,terraform]
----
resource "ansible_host" "my_ec2" {
  name   = aws_instance.my_ec2.public_dns
  groups = ["nginx"]
  variables = {
    ansible_user                 = "ec2-user",
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file = "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
    ansible_python_interpreter   = "/usr/bin/python3",
  }
}
----

. **Create and run a deployment script.**
+
**Create** a file named `deploy.sh` and make it executable.
+
[source,bash]
----
chmod +x deploy.sh
----
+
**Paste** the following content into `deploy.sh`.
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
set -eux

terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml nginx.yml

ip=$(ansible-inventory -i inventory.yml --list | jq -r '.nginx.hosts[0]')
curl "http://${ip}" --fail
----
+
**Run** the script. It will provision the infrastructure with Terraform, configure it with Ansible, and test the result with `curl`.
+
[source,bash]
----
./deploy.sh
----

. **Verify the inventory.**
+
**Check** the Ansible inventory to see the host that was added by the provider.
+
[source,bash]
----
ansible-inventory -i inventory.yml --graph --vars
----

. **Clean up resources.**
+
**Destroy** the infrastructure using Terraform.
+
[source,bash]
----
terraform destroy
----
+
When prompted, **type** `yes` to confirm.

---

== Task 3: Use the Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform

This task shows how the `ansible/aap` provider can push host information from a Terraform run directly into an Ansible Automation Platform inventory.

. **Navigate to the project directory.**
+
[source,bash]
----
cd /home/rhel/lab_exercises/4.Terraform_AAP_Provider
----

. **Modify the `main.tf` file.**
+
**Edit** `main.tf` and **uncomment** the three sections related to the AAP provider:
+
* The `aap` provider in the `required_providers` block.
* The `provider "aap"` configuration block.
* The `resource "aap_host"` block at the end of the file.

. **Initialize, plan, and apply.**
+
**Run** the standard Terraform workflow to build the infrastructure.
+
[source,bash]
----
terraform init
terraform plan -out myInstanceForAAP
terraform apply myInstanceForAAP
----

. **Verify the host in AAP.**
+
**Log in** to Ansible Automation Platform and **navigate** to `Resources â†’ Inventories`. **Select** the `Terraform Inventory` and go to the `Hosts` tab. You will see the new host (`aws_instance_tf`) that was added directly by the Terraform provider.

== Conclusion

You have now explored three powerful ways to integrate Terraform and Ansible. You've used the `cloud.terraform` collection to orchestrate Terraform from an Ansible Playbook and used two different Terraform providers (`ansible/ansible` and `ansible/aap`) to manage Ansible inventories directly from a Terraform workflow. These tools provide immense flexibility for building your automation strategy.
