== Overview

Terraform is a leading Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for deploying and managing cloud infrastructure. When combined with Ansible's Configuration as Code (CaC) capabilities, you can create a robust, end-to-end automation workflow.

*Estimated time to complete: 45 minutes*

.In this first challenge, you will learn how to:
* Configure a **Terraform Backend Credential** to securely store state files.
* Create and configure a **Terraform Inventory** source.
* Build and run an **Ansible Job Template** that uses Terraform to create resources in AWS.

---

== Task 1: Configure the Terraform Backend Credential

The `Terraform Backend Credential Type` in Ansible Automation Platform allows you to securely store and manage the configuration for any remote Terraform backend. In this lab, you'll store the Terraform state file in an AWS S3 bucket.

=== Retrieve the S3 Bucket Name from AWS

First, you need the name of the S3 bucket where Terraform will store its state files.

. **Navigate to the AWS Console.**
+
**Click** the `AWS Console` tab at the top of the lab page to view your temporary account details.
+

. **Log in to AWS.**
+
**Use** the provided `Account ID`, `Username`, and `Password` to log in to the AWS Management Console.
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/awslogin.png?raw=true[AWS Login Screen, 800, opts="border"]

. **Find the S3 Bucket Name.**
+
Once logged in, **use** the top search bar to find and select the `S3` service. You will see an existing S3 bucket created for you.
+
**Make a note** of its full name, which will look similar to `aap-tf-bucket-###...`. You will need this name shortly.
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/awss3name.png?raw=true[S3 Bucket Name, 800, opts="border"]

=== Create the Terraform Backend Credential in Ansible

Now, you will create the credential in Ansible Automation Platform to access the S3 backend.

. **Log in to Ansible Automation Platform.**
+
**Click** the `Ansible Automation Platform` tab and log in with the following credentials:
+
* **User:** `admin`
* **Password:** `ansible123!`

. **Navigate to Credentials.**
+
In the left-hand menu, **navigate** to `Administration â†’ Credentials`.

. **Examine existing credentials.**
+
Take a moment to look at the pre-configured credentials, such as `AWS_Credential` and `SSH Controller Credentials`, which are used for authenticating to cloud providers and machines.

NOTE: Keys and secrets are encrypted within Ansible Automation Platform. Once saved, they cannot be viewed or retrieved, even by an administrator.

. **Create a new credential.**
+
**Click** the `+ Create credential` button.

. **Enter credential details.**
+
**Fill out** the form with the following information:
* **Name:** `Terraform Backend Credential`
* **Credential Type:** `Terraform backend configuration`

. **Configure the backend.**
+
In the `Type Details` section, **paste** the following configuration snippet into the `Backend configuration` box.
+
[source,hcl]
----
bucket = "aap-tf-bucket-ALONG-LISTOF-CHARACTERS-CHANGE-ME"
key = "YOURNAME/tfstatefile"
region = "us-east-1"
access_key = "YOUR-LAB-awsaccesskey-CHANGE-ME"
secret_key = "YOUR-LAB-awssecretkey-CHANGE-ME"
----
+
WARNING: You *must* update this configuration with your specific details.
+
* **`bucket`**: Replace with the S3 bucket name you copied from the AWS console.
* **`key`**: Replace `YOURNAME` with your name or a unique identifier (e.g., `johnsmith/tfstatefile`).
* **`access_key`** and **`secret_key`**: Replace with the AWS Access Key and Secret Key from the `AWS Console` lab tab.
+

Your final configuration will look similar to this example:
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/tfbackendcred.png?raw=true[Terraform Backend Credential Configuration, opts="border"]

. **Save the credential.**
+
**Click** the `Create credential` button.

---

== Task 2: Configure the Terraform Inventory

An inventory is a collection of hosts against which automation is run. You can dynamically source inventory from cloud providers, including from a Terraform state file.

. **Navigate to Inventories.**
+
In the left-hand menu, **navigate** to `Resources â†’ Inventories`.

. **Select the existing inventory.**
+
**Click** on the inventory named `Terraform Inventory`, then select the `Sources` tab.

. **Create a new inventory source.**
+
**Click** the `+ Create source` button and fill in the form with the following details.
+
.Terraform Source Details
|===
| Field | Value
| Name | `Terraform Source`
| Execution environment | `Terraform Execution Environment`
| Source | `Terraform State`
| Credential | `Terraform Backend Credential`
| Overwrite | âœ… **Check**
| Update on launch | âœ… **Check**
| Source variables | `backend_type: s3`
|===
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/tfinventorysource1.png?raw=true[Create Inventory Source, opts="border"]

. **Save and sync the source.**
+
**Click** `Create source`. On the next screen, **click** the `Launch inventory update` button to synchronize the inventory. This action validates your credential and source configuration.
+
**Wait** for the status to show `Success`.
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/tfinventorysource2.png?raw=true[Inventory Sync Success, 800, opts="border"]

NOTE: If the inventory update fails, the most likely cause is an error in the `Terraform Backend Credential`. Please review and correct the bucket name, key, and AWS credentials.

---

== Task 3: Create a Job Template (AWS Provider)

In this task, you'll create a Job Template that runs a simple Terraform project to provision an EC2 instance in AWS.

NOTE: This same process can be used to manage resources in other cloud environments like Azure and Google Cloud.

=== Create and Launch the Job Template

. **Navigate to Templates.**
+
In the left-hand menu, **navigate** to `Resources â†’ Templates` and **click** `+ Create template`, then select `Create job template`.
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/create_templates1st.png?raw=true[Create Job Template, 800, opts="border"]

. **Enter template details.**
+
**Fill out** the form with the following values:
+
.Job Template Details
|===
| Field | Value
| Name | `Deploy AWS resources using Terraform AWS provider`
| Inventory | `Terraform Inventory`
| Project | `Terraform Demos Project`
| Playbook | `playbooks/1deploy-terraform-aws-provider.yml`
| Execution environment | `Terraform Execution Environment`
| Credentials | `AWS_Credential` AND `Terraform Backend Credential`
|===
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/create_templates2.png?raw=true[Job Template Configuration, 800, opts="border"]

. **Save and launch the template.**
+
**Click** the `Create job template` button to save. From the Templates list, **click** the rocket icon (ðŸš€) to launch the job.

. **Observe the job output.**
+
Watch the job as it runs. You will see Terraform being initialized and applied.
+

=== Manually Synchronize the Terraform Inventory

. **Check the inventory hosts.**
+
**Return** to `Resources â†’ Inventories`, select `Terraform Inventory`, and click the `Hosts` tab. Notice that no hosts are listed yet.
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/tfinventoryhosts1.png?raw=true[Inventory Hosts - Before Sync, 800, opts="border"]

. **Sync the inventory source.**
+
**Click** the `Sources` tab and **click** the rocket icon (ðŸš€) for your `Terraform Source` to launch an inventory update.
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/tfinventorysource3.png?raw=true[Launch Inventory Update, 800, opts="border"]

. **View the new host.**
+
**Return** to the `Hosts` tab. You will now see the new EC2 instance created by Terraform as part of your inventory.
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/tfinventoryhosts2.png?raw=true[Inventory Hosts - After Sync, 800, opts="border"]

=== Task 3 Summary

You successfully created a job template that triggered a Terraform project to provision an AWS resource. You then synchronized the inventory to pull the new host into Ansible Automation Platform. This demonstrates a powerful "better together" story for infrastructure provisioning and configuration management!

.Terraform Project (`main.tf`)
[source,terraform]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "6.2.0"
    }
  }
  backend "s3" {}
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Fetch the default VPC
data "aws_vpc" "default" {
  default = true
}

resource "aws_instance" "tf-demo-aws-ec2-instance-1" {
  ami           = "ami-0005e0cfe09cc9050"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "tf-demo-aws-ec2-instance-1"
  }
}

== Task 4: Create a Job Template (AWS & AAP Providers)

In this final task, you will see how the Terraform Provider for Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) can automatically update the inventory, removing the need for a manual sync.

=== Create and Launch the Job Template

. **Create a new job template.**
+
**Navigate** back to `Resources â†’ Templates` and **click** `+ Create template` â†’ `Create job template`.
+
image::https://github.com/HichamMourad/terraform-aap/blob/main/images/create_templates.png?raw=true[Create Job Template, 800, opts="border"]

. **Enter template details.**
+
.Job Template Details
|===
| Field | Value
| Name | `Deploy AWS resources using Terraform AWS & ANSIBLE-AAP provider`
| Inventory | `Terraform Inventory`
| Project | `Terraform Demos Project`
| Playbook | `playbooks/2deploy-terraform-ansible-provider.yml`
| Execution environment | `Terraform Execution Environment`
| Credentials | `AWS_Credential` AND `Terraform Backend Credential`
|===

. **Save and launch the template.**
+
**Click** `Create job template` and then **launch** the new template by clicking its rocket icon (ðŸš€).

=== View the Updated Inventory

. **Check the inventory hosts.**
+
Once the job completes, **return** to the `Hosts` tab of your `Terraform Inventory` (`Resources â†’ Inventories â†’ Terraform Inventory â†’ Hosts`).
+
You will see a second EC2 instance has been automatically added to the inventory. The Terraform provider for AAP directly registered the new host, eliminating the need for a separate sync step.
+

=== Task 4 Summary

In this task, you used a Terraform project that included the `ansible/aap` provider. This provider allows Terraform to interact directly with the Ansible Automation Platform API to create, modify, or delete resources like inventory hosts. This further enhances the "better together" story by giving infrastructure operators more choice and flexibility in how they build their automation workflows.

.Terraform Project with AAP Provider (`main.tf`)
[source,terraform]
----
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "6.2.0"
    }
    aap = {
      source = "ansible/aap"
    }
  }
  backend "s3" {}
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "tf-demo-aws-ec2-instance-2" {
  ami           = "ami-0005e0cfe09cc9050"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "tf-demo-aws-ec2-instance-2"
  }
}

provider "aap" {
  host               = "https://controller"
  username           = "admin"
  password           = "ansible123!"
  insecure_skip_verify = true
}

resource "aap_host" "tf-demo-aws-ec2-instance-2" {
  inventory_id = 2
  name         = "aws_instance_tf-demo-aws-ec2-instance-2"
  description  = "An EC2 instance created by Terraform"
  variables    = jsonencode(aws_instance.tf-demo-aws-ec2-instance-2)
}
----
